A conversational AI Agent that researches the web, analyzes your images and files, runs code, and creates documents, visualizations, and reports—all through simple chat.

## Why It Matters

- **One simple interface for everyone** - No settings to configure, no models to choose
- **Automated intelligence** - The agent automatically selects the best approach for your task
- **Ask in any language, get exactly what you need in minutes** - From data analysis to document creation
- All the power of **coding, research, file QA and analysis**, accessible through 
simple conversation

## How It Works (Any language)

**You ask → It delivers:**

- *"Help me understand this research paper and summarize the key points"* → Reads PDF, creates clear summary
- *"Analyze my spending data and show me where my money goes"* → Creates charts and insights from your files
- *"Write a Python script to organize my photo collection"* → Generates working code with instructions
- *"Compare these job offers and help me decide"* → Reads documents, creates comparison table
- *"Create a study guide from these lecture notes"* → Processes files, creates formatted study materials

## What You Get From Simple Conversations

- **Clear explanations** with charts, graphs, and visual aids in multiple formats
- **Custom visualizations** — from simple charts to complex data analysis and interactive graphics
- **Useful files** — organized spreadsheets, formatted documents, working code
- **Current information** from web research with sources you can trust
- **Any kind of popular output formats** — Excel, CSV, HTML reports, PNG images, PDFs, JSON and more

## Where It Shines (What People Actually Ask For)

- **Students**: *"Help me understand this complex topic and create flashcards"* → Study materials with explanations
- **Researchers**: *"Analyze this dataset and find interesting patterns"* → Data insights with visualizations  
- **Developers**: *"Write code to solve this problem and explain how it works"* → Working scripts with documentation
- **Content Creators**: *"Turn this data into an engaging infographic"* → Visual content with clear design
- **Anyone**: *"Research this topic and create a simple summary I can share"* → Clear reports with sources

## What Makes It Powerful (Under the Hood)

- **Intelligent task routing** - automatically determines the best approach for your request
- **Always searches the web first** for current, accurate information
- **Reads 20+ file types** including PDFs, Excel, PowerPoint, images, CSVs
- **Runs real analysis** using Python with 100+ data science and visualization libraries  
- **Generates multiple file formats** — spreadsheets, documents, code, presentations, data files
- **Remembers your preferences** across conversations for consistent results

## The Unified Agent Interface

**One Agent, All Capabilities:**

```text
You ask: "Compare this chart image with my reports and create outputs"
   ↓
Agent automatically searches web for latest info
   ↓  
Agent reads all your uploaded documents
   ↓
Agent analyzes chart image using vision
   ↓
Agent runs code to process everything
   ↓
Returns: Excel + HTML + PNG charts + PDF summary
```

**Zero Configuration Required:**
- No model selection needed - uses the best available automatically
- No parameter tuning - optimized settings applied internally
- No workflow setup - agent determines optimal approach for each task

**Detailed Flow:**
